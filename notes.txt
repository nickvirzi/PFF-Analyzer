Maybe come up with a new metric
For WR when in zone check against coverage of LB/CB/S
For WR when in man check against coverage of CB/S

New Defense metric
Percent of man/zone played by cov groups above = # of cov snaps in man/zone / # of cov snaps in man + zone
(yards allowed per target (x games) by cov groups in zone/man * Percent of man/zone + (man/zon opposite)) * 0.5
or
(yards allowed per target (x games) by cov groups in zone/man * Percent of tgts in man/zone + (man/zone opposite)) * 0.5

New Offensive metric
Routes run per game * % of opponent scheme by cov groups * yards/Rec per route run in man/zone

Targets per game in man/zone %
Yards per target (x games) in man/zone 

(Yards per target (x games) in man/zone * % Targets (x games) in man/zone + (man/zone opposite)) * 0.5

Overall YardPTgtScore = (yards allowed per target (x games) by cov groups in zone/man * Percent of tgts in man/zone + (man/zone opposite)) + 0.5 + (Yards per target (x games) in man/zone * % Targets (x games) in man/zone + (man/zone opposite)) * 0.5
